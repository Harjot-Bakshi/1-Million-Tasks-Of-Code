'''Comments - Comments are a way to add some instructions in a code so that we can give context to what the code is about. Instead of inputting what the coding is doing like we are adding a values of 5 to the variable d; we generally use comments to input what the code intends to, for example: assigning the distance to the variable d to calculate speed. We use multiple ways to comment (1)Single-Line Comments: Use the # symbol to add comments on a single line. Anything following # on that line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter. (2) Python doesnâ€™t have a specific multi-line comment syntax, but you can use triple quotes """ to create multi-line strings that act as comments.'''
'''Input is a function used to input from user(s) end'''
d = 5 # assigning distance to a variable d to calculate speed
t = 10
s = d/t
print(s)
