# 1 Million Tasks of Code

Hey there! Welcome to **1 Million Tasks of Code**. I'm just a coding enthusiast with no formal coding / engineering background, learning Python one step at a time. Sometimes, I struggle with motivation and thought, "Hey, maybe others do too!" 

So, I‚Äôm creating this project as a huge coding playground for anyone who wants to join. From the absolute basics to advanced stuff, this repo has it all. I‚Äôm planning to dive into more languages and frameworks over time, and I want this to be a community where we can share, learn, and grow together. 

Even if just one person finds this useful, it‚Äôll make all the effort worthwhile. If you‚Äôre here to code, learn, or contribute, jump in! Whether you're just starting or looking for advanced challenges, there‚Äôs something here for everyone.

**Let‚Äôs make coding a fun, free, and accessible part of our lives!**

## üìÇ What's Inside?

- **Python/**: Starting with Python basics and moving to more advanced topics.
- **Future_Languages/**: Placeholder for other languages and frameworks.
