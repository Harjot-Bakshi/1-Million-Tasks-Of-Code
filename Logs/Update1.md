Initially when I started I thought to add some basic info and then add a question or a task and then work on it but after a couple of Tasks (Only 5) I understood one thing it is as if I am trying to create a book which by no reason I am the perfect one to create and I should rather add a task and then focus on completing it, so from Task 6 and onwards I wont be adding any unnecessary comments and rather working on resolving things and anyone can have a basic idea and then work on it. More like a good question and answer way or a task and resolution way
